# Web-Server-Automation
Repository used to automate VMWare, VApp machines in VCloud

Contains a handful of other scripts that are related to this function for your use. 

These haven't been updated since early 2018 (this most recent commit is just to move between hosting providers). 
So the scripts are:

1) Awful (I was only just starting on my VMWare & PowerShell journey with automation
2) May not be working (I'd say this is almost a certainty)
